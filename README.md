## Overview

<a href="#">Proxyman for macOS</a> is built for developers and QA engineers who depend on understanding HTTP(S) traffic during everyday work. It acts as a debugging proxy, capturing requests and responses from browsers, mobile simulators and native apps so you can see what is actually being sent and received. Traffic can be grouped, filtered and searched, making it straightforward to isolate specific endpoints, sessions or errors among the noise of a busy system.

Breakpoints, rewrite rules and <a href="#">map-local or map-remote</a> features let users modify traffic on the fly. This is valuable for simulating edge cases, testing error handling or reproducing problematic conditions without changing backend code. TLS support and certificate management are tuned for a macOS environment, lowering friction when intercepting secure traffic during development. With clear inspectors for headers, bodies and timing, Proxyman helps teams debug performance as well as correctness issues.

As a macOS app, Proxyman respects window management, dark mode and keyboard-driven workflows. It can sit on a second monitor, quietly capturing traffic until a bug appears that needs investigation. Saved workspaces retain filters and configurations for specific projects, cutting down on repetitive setup. Over time, it becomes a trusted lens on application behaviour, complementing logs and metrics with a concrete view of what moves across the wire.
